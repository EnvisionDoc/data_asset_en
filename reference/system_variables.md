# Supported System Variables

<br />

You can not only use variables in path and parameter settings, but also  directly in your SHELL script.

<br />

For example, in creating a data synchronization job for synchronizing data from EnOS Hive to a target database, when setting the partition value, you can select **Placeholder** as the method of specifying the partition, and enter the name of the system variable to be used. The system will load partition information automatically according to the specified variable.

## Business-related Variables

Before you start to use the service-related variables, note the following key concepts.

### Triggering Time

The time when a workflow is triggered. It can be the time when you manually trigger the workflow, or when the workflow is automatically triggered according to scheduling settings.

### Business Date

The date when the workflow starts to process the data. The date is calculated by deducting one day from the triggering time (because the workflow processes the data of the previous day by default). 

<br />

For example, if the triggering time is `2017-05-27 13:50:00`, and the scheduled cycle is one day, the business date will be `2017-05-26`, which means that the data on `2017-05-26` will be processed at the triggering time `2017-05-27 13:50:00`. Therefore, if you want to process data for 2018-03-01, you need to set the triggering time to 2018-03-02.
