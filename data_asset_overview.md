# About Data Asset Management

EnOS Data Asset Management offering targets to help you optimize your total cost of ownership for your data assets on EnOS. The service mainly brings the following benefits:

- Strong data analytics capability
- High data development efficiency and lower barrier of stream data processing development
- Optimized cost of data storage due to more flexible configuration
- Effective data retention and access based on domain expertise accumulation
- Quick and easy data query for data insights
- Cleanup of historical data for releasing storage resource
- Multiple data quality measuring dimensions
- Metadata exploring of models and measuring points
- Subscription to device real-time data and alert data

## Stream Analytics

The essence of stream analytics is to ensure low-latency of stream data transmission and processing, as well as high accuracy of data analytics. To achieve these goals, EnOS Stream Analytics not only provides high throughput, low latency stream processing, but also accumulated the leading and most frequently used stream processing algorithms for certain industries. The service provides visualized template-based configuration to help you quickly perform your stream analytics tasks and task monitoring. Besides, EnOS Stream Analytics also provides a set of underlying packaged StreamSets operators for developers to develop customized stream data processing jobs to meet the requirements of various business scenarios. For more information, see overview of [Stream Analytics](learn/streaming_overview).

## Time Series Data Management

EnOS TSDB provides efficient and stable storage and management for time series data that is ingested from devices or generated by the stream processing engine. EnOS provides a variety of data storage options for you based on your data storage and reading requirements. Data is stored by categories (data type and storage time), thus reducing data storage costs and enhancing data reading efficiency.

With the Data Insights feature, you can view the latest data ingested from your devices and also generate a chart for time series data that is stored in TSDB by selecting a specific time range and device measuring points, thus improve the efficiency of data analysis. 

With the Data Cleanup feature, you can delete historical data (wrong data, informal data, or useless business data) that is stored in TSDB for releasing storage resource and saving data storage costs. For more information, see [Managing Time Series Data](howto/storage/index).

Note: Data storage policy must be configured before the devices start uploading data to EnOS Cloud. Otherwise, the uploaded device data will not be stored in EnOS TSDB by default.

## Data Quality

EnOS supports data quality assessment by multiple dimensions. Data records can be tagged with quality index by stream processing jobs that are developed by composing StreamSets stages. Therefore, you can check the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of data in the generated data reports. For more information, see [Data Quality](learn/data_quality)。

## Data Asset Explorer

EnOS supports exploring the metadata of models and measuring points, including basic information, the stream processing lineage and storage configuration of measuring points, and all the instances that are associated with the model to which a measuring point belongs. For more information, see [Data Asset Explorer](learn/metadata_explorer)。

## Data Subscription

Data subscription service targets to improve the API calling efficiency of applications with active data push, which supports subscription to various data types such as real-time asset data and asset alert data. Java SDK is provided for retrieving the subscribed data. For more information, see overview of [Data Subscription](learn/data_subscription_overview).

## Data Service APIs

EnOS Data Asset Management offering provides Data Service APIs for getting stored data in EnOS TSDB. For  detailed information about Date Service APIs, go to **EnOS Console > EnOS API**.



## Targeted Personas

EnOS Data Asset Management offering primarily serves the following roles:
