# About Data Asset Management

EnOSâ„¢ Data Asset Management helps you properly manage the data that is ingested from the devices that are connected with EnOS Cloud. EnOS Data Asset Management enables you to process stream data, subscribe to real-time and alert data, customize data storage policies, and retrieve stored data with APIs.



## Targeted Personas

EnOS Data Asset Management Service primarily serves the following roles:

**Data Developer**

Data developer, who configures data subscription settings, designs data processing streams, and defines data storage policies through the EnOS Console.

**Application Developer**

Application developer, who develops applications to get the subscribed or stored data via EnOS APIs and SDKs to fulfill requirements of certain business case scenarios.



## Key Capabilities

In general, EnOS Data Asset Management has the following capabilities:

**Stream data analytics**

The computation the engine processes is real-time and streaming, and the data streams are subscribed and consumed by stream computing in chronological order.

Because the data is generated continuously, the data streams are integrated to the streaming system continuously. For example, website access log is a type of stream data, the log continuously records data as long as the website is online. Thus, the stream data is always real-time and unbounded.

**Data subscription**

With data subscription configuration enabled, you can subscribe to real-time asset data and asset alert data. Benefiting from the data subscription service, applications do not need to call APIs repeatedly and frequently to get asset data. Instead, applications call APIs only when there are pushed data, thus improving API calling efficiency and reducing costs.

**Data storage policy**

EnOS provides a variety of data storage options for you based on your data storage and reading requirements. Data is stored by categories (data type and storage time), thus reducing data storage costs and enhancing data reading efficiency.
