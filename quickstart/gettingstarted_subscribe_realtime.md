# Subscribing to Real-time Data

This guide introduces how to configure real-time data subscription on EnOS Console and consume data with the Java SDK provided by EnOS.

## Prerequisites

- Access permission to the Data Subscription module.
- Device connection is completed, and the devices are uploading data to EnOS.
- The service account (SA) for subscribing data has been authorized to access asset data.
- A workstation with IDE (IDEA or Eclipse) installed.

## About This Task

**Goal**

The goal of this guide is to subscribe to the real-time data of the *test_raw* measuring point.

**Data Preparation**

- **Model configuration**: Detailed information about the (*testModel*) for this guide is as follows:

| Feature Type  | Name     | Identifier | Point Type | Data Type |
|:--------------|:---------|:-----------|:-----------|:----------|
| Measuring Point | test_raw | test_raw   | AI         | DOUBLE    |

For information about device connection and data ingestion, see [Device Connection](/docs/device-connection/en/latest/quickstart/gettingstarted_device_connection.html).

## Procedure

The steps for subscribing and consuming real-time data are as follows:

- Create and configure a real-time data subscription topic
- Save and enable the subscription topic
- Get subscribed data with Java SDK
- Check the data consumption results

## Step 1. Create and Configure a Data Subscription Topic

Log in EnOS Console and select the **Data Subscription** module. All the subscription topics created for the current organization are listed in the table. Take the following steps to create and configure a real-time data subscription topic.

1. **Create topic**: Click the **New Subscription** button and complete the configuration for the topic. For this guide, select **Real-time Data Subscription** as the type.

2. **Subscription ID**: Choose to input or generate an ID for the subscription topic.

3. **Select SA account**: Each consumer instance must have an associated SA account, which can be generated by registering an application on EnOS. For instructions, see [Managing Applications](/docs/app-development/en/latest/managing_apps.html).

   .. note:: The SA account associated with the data subscription job must be authorized to access the asset data. Otherwise, the data subscription job will fail because of authentication failure. For more information about authorizing the SA account, see [Managing Service Accounts](/docs/iam/en/latest/howto/service_account/managing_service_account.html). 

4. **Select data to be subscribed**: Each SA can access the data of multiple clients (through purchasing applications). Select the clients whose data are to be subscribed to.

5. **Set model and measuring point filter**: Select the model and measuring points to be subscribed to. For this guide, select *test_raw* the *testModel*. The subscription system will filter data to meet the specified conditions.

6. **Set device tag filter**: Specify tags of devices so that data of the selected devices will be subscribed to.

## Step 2. Save and Enable the Subscription Topic

After the subscription topic is configured, click **Save** to save the configuration. On the **Data Subscription** page, find the saved topic, click the **Enable** icon to run the subscription topic.

## Step 3. Get Subscribed Data with Java SDK

EnOS provides Java SDK to help developers with offline application development and data consumption.
- Add [Maven dependency](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.envisioniot/enos-subscribe/2.2.0) for the SDK. See the following example:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.envisioniot</groupId>
  <artifactId>enos-subscribe</artifactId>
  <version>2.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

- Use IDE for offline application development. See the following code sample:


```
String sub_server_host ="sub_server_host";
int sub_server_port ="sub_server_port";
String accessKey ="access_Key";
String secretKey ="secret_Key";
String subId = "subscriptionId";

/* service */
EOSClient eosClient = new EOSClient(sub_server_host, sub_server_port, accessKey, secretKey);
IDataService dataService = eosClient.getDataService();

/* handler */
IDataHandler dataHandler = new IDataHandler(){
    @Override
    public void dataRead(MeasurePoint point) {
        System.out.println(point);
    }
};
/* subscribe */
dataService.subscribe(dataHandler, subId);

/* subscribe with consumer group */
dataService.subscribe(dataHandler, subId, consumerGroup);
```

.. note:: In this sample, the `sub_server_host` and `sub_server_port` are the host and port of the subscription server, which vary with the cloud region and instance. For private cloud instances, contact your Envision project manager or support representative to get the host and port information.

For more information about the SDK, see [Data Subscription SDK Reference](../reference/data_subscription_sdk).

## Step 4. Check the Data Consumption Results

Run the application for data consumption and check the data consumption results in the logs of the application.
