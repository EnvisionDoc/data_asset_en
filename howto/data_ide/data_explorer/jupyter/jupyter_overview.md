# Jupyter Notebook Overview

<br />

Jupyter Notebook is an interactive data exploration tool that supports multiple programming languages. It allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and so on.

<br />

Jupyter Notebook allows data engineers and scientists to perform data visualization in the same environment, create shared code and documents, simplify their workflow, and achieve higher productivity and better collaboration.

<br />

Besides creating, deleting, editing, and download notebook, Jupyter Notebook also supports online programming and computing, assisting with continuous development.

<br />

With the above features, Jupyter Notebook provides a unified interactive data exploration and analysis environment, in which you can compile and run your code, view the output, visualize data and view the results. It can be used in your end-to-end data science workflow, including data cleaning, modeling, building and training machine learning models, and visualizing data.

<br />

Currently, the Jupyter Notebook integrated with EnOS Data Sandbox Service supports Python 2, Python 3, and R.
