# Preparing the Container Resource

<br />

Before running batch data processing tasks (such as Python and Shell type tasks) for batch data analysis, you need to request the Batch Processing - Container resource on the EnOS Management Console.


## Requesting for the Container Resource

1. Log in to the **EnOS Management Console** with OU administrator account and click **Resource Management** from the left navigation panel.

2. Under the **Enterprise Data Platform** tab, click the **Request Resource** button for the **Batch Processing - Container** resource.

3. Select the needed resource specification and click the **Request** button.

<br />

After the container resource request is approved, and the status of the request becomes to *Allocated*, you can start running your batch data processing tasks.


## Deleting the Container Resource

If you do not need to run batch data processing tasks, you can stop all your tasks and then delete the requested container resource on the **Resource Management** page of EnOS Management Console to save costs.
