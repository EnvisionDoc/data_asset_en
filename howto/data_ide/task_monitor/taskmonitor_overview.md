# Workflow Operation Overview

<br />

When a workflow is published, the workflow will be run automatically according to the scheduling parameters or will be run manually when you pre-run it.

<br />

The Workflow Operation module enables you to view the running status and perform monitoring actions.

## Key Concepts

### Instance

Once a workflow is triggered manually or automatically according to scheduling parameter, an instance will be generated. An instance represents a snapshot of a workflow being executed at a specific time and contains task runtime, running status, running log, and other information.

## Major Functions

The workflow operation enables you to do the following:

- View details about your workflows and perform workflow monitoring such as pre-running, starting, and pausing the workflows.
- View details for the instances for each workflow and perform instance monitoring actions such as rerunning and stopping.
- View logs of all the instances and troubleshooting information.
