Data Deletion
=======================

The Data Deletion feature of the EnOS Time Series Data Management supports the cleaning of the historical data that is stored in the Time Series Database (TSDB) and the latest data that is stored in the In-memory Database (IMDB) to release storage resource and reduce data storage costs.

- **Data in TSDB**: Cleans the historical data of specific models, measurement points, and assets in the specified time range.
- **Latest Data**: Cleans the latest data of specific models, measurement points, and assets.
