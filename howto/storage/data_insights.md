# Data Insights Overview

<br />

Through the data insights service, data charts based on time range and device measurement points can be generated for the time series data stored in TSDB to improve the efficiency of data analysis. The service has the following features.

<br />

**Querying Data by Time Range**

Data can be queried and presented by the specified time range based on the data event time. You can choose to query data for 1 hour, 1 day, or 1 week, or customize your own time range.

<br />

**Supporting Multiple Devices and Measurement Points**

Supports the simultaneous query and presentation of data from multiple devices and multiple measurement points and dynamically displays the queried data in a chart for the selected devices and measurement points.

<br />

**Presenting Data bMeasurement Point Type**

You can query and present data by measurement point types. The measurement points that can be selected are dynamically displayed based on the measurement point type (AI, DI, PI, and Generic).

<br />

**Aggregating Data**

Data can be aggregated and presented by the built-in aggregation functions. The supported aggregate functions include count, sum, avg, max, min, first, and last, and the aggregation interval options are 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour.

<br />

**Data Visualization**

For the data that is queried, you can choose to display it in the form of a chart or a list. If you choose to view the data in a chart, you can zoom in and out to see the details of each data point.
