EnOS Time Series Database (TSDB) provides efficient and stable storage and management for time series data that is ingested from devices or generated by the stream processing engine. EnOS TSDB can not only store massive time series data, but also support fast query of the store data for data visualization. You can store your business data by categories (data types and storage time) based your data storage and data reading requirements, thus reducing data storage costs and enhancing data reading efficiency.
